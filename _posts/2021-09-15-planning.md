## Reflections:

Overall this closed meeting was successful as we were able to update information that new members and returning members will be able to see during our schoolâ€™s activity fair. During the activity fair itself, we were able to recruit many new freshmen and sophomores who are excited to be part of a STEM activity and interact with their peers after being isolated for about 1.5 years.
